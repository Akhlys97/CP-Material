# My own Approaches to Understanding a Problem

1. **Keep it Math-Focused**: The main goal is to turn the problem into a math model. If a story helps, fine, but cut out the extra details.

2. **Explain Like You're Teaching**: Imagine telling the problem to a friend. What's crucial? Share that.

3. **Short and Sweet Wins**: The shorter and simpler, the better. Complexity isn't cool here.

4. **Go for Simple Solutions**: Simple beats complicated. Aim for elegance.

5. **Know the Limits**: Pay attention to restrictions, especially when dealing with small amounts of data. Sometimes trying everything is an option.

6. **Check with Samples**: Make sure your math model works on provided examples, especially the quick and easy ones.

7. **Spot the Familiar Stuff**: See if you recognize any patterns or things you've dealt with before.

8. **Look for Odd Things**: If something seems weird, it might be crucial. Pay attention.

9. **Change What You Don't Like**: If a part bugs you, change it into something you like. Start by understanding, then simplify.

10. **Break It Down**: If it's a big problem, chop it into smaller pieces. Solve them one by one, like a series of steps.

11. **Write it Out**: Putting your thoughts on paper, even by hand, can help a lot.

12. **Trust the Problem Statement**: Assume the problem info is there for a reason. If something seems odd, it's probably important.
